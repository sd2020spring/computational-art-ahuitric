# Computational Art

This project recursively generates art based on random math equations that

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Pillow fork from the Python Imaging Library will need to be installed in order
to run this program. This can be done by running the following line in a Linux
terminal:

'''python
$ conda install Pillow
'''

## Running the tests

To run the doc tests for this system, run the program from a Linux terminal. If there is no output, all the doc tests
have passed. There is a second test at the end of the code that is most likely commented out, and will need to be uncommented in order to be run. 

### Break down into end to end tests

The doc test checks if the math performing functions are working correctly. There is a latter test that checks if the
PIL is working.
